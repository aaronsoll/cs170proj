# CS 170 Project Fall 2021

### How to run the solver:
1. Make sure the `cs170proj` folder contains and folder titled  `inputs` and a folder titled `outputs`, and that each of these two folder have subfolders titled `small`, `medium`, and `large`. Within each subfolder in `inputs` should be the input files that are to be run through the algorithm.
2. Make sure solver.py is located in `cs170proj`, and run it to generate the output files for each input file in `inputs`. Existing files in `outputs` may be overwritten!
3. Hyperparameters such as `COPY_DIST` and `NUM_COPIES` can be edited to improve runtime at the expense of performance.
